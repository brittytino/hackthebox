## 🔴 ROUND 1: "THE BREACH DISCOVERY"
**Story Arc:** Veera infiltrates the mall, discovers the command center

### Level 1.1: The Intercepted Transmission
**Time:** 3:47 AM  
**Location:** Hidden server room, basement level  
**Story Moment:** Veera taps into the terrorist network and intercepts an encrypted message

**Narrative Context:**
```
Veera has managed to access the mall's backup server room. He's monitoring 
terrorist communications, but they're using triple-layer encryption 
(Base64 → ROT13 → Reverse). Decode the intercepted message to reveal 
the location of Saif's command center.

HOSTAGE STATUS: 1,200 trapped | 0 rescued
TERRORISTS: Unknown number, all armed
TIME TO NEXT EXECUTION: 28 minutes
```

**Veera's Message (display before challenge):**
*"I've tapped into their network. They're overconfident—using predictable encoding. Decode this transmission and tell me where their command center is. I'll handle the rest. Move fast."*

**After solving:**
*"Command center confirmed: Server Room ER-42, East Wing. Good work. Moving to infiltrate now."*

---

### Level 1.2: The Fragmented Server Map
**Time:** 4:15 AM  
**Location:** Approaching Server Room ER-42  
**Story Moment:** Veera needs the access code, but it's split across three encrypted files

**Narrative Context:**
```
Saif has fragmented the server room access code across three separate files,
each encrypted differently (Hex, Binary, Caesar cipher). Decode all three
and combine them to unlock the door before Veera is discovered by patrols.

HOSTAGE STATUS: 1,200 trapped | 0 rescued
TERRORISTS: 15+ confirmed sleeper cells
TIME TO NEXT EXECUTION: 15 minutes
```

**Vikram's Message (Tamil Nadu Police HQ):**
*"We've intercepted three encrypted files from their network. Each one is a fragment of the access code. Decode them all and assemble in order: Fragment A, Fragment B, Fragment C. Veera's counting on you."*

**After solving:**
*"Access granted. Veera is inside Server Room ER-42. Stand by for update."*

---

### Level 1.3: The Time-Locked Vault
**Time:** 4:45 AM  
**Location:** Inside Server Room ER-42  
**Story Moment:** Veera finds the vault containing terrorist attack plans

**Narrative Context:**
```
Server Room ER-42 contains a biometric time-locked vault. The security
log shows a mathematical unlock formula based on event timestamps and
team parameters. Calculate your unique code to open the vault.

HOSTAGE STATUS: 1,180 trapped | 20 rescued (Veera cleared a sector)
TERRORISTS: 12 active (3 eliminated by Veera)
TIME TO NEXT EXECUTION: 9 minutes
BREAKING: First hostage executed on live TV
```

**Veera's Message:**
*"The vault is time-locked. Formula requires your team's exact registration timestamp, member count, and current round. This is personalized security—every team calculates their own code. I need this NOW."*

**After solving:**
*"Vault open. Extracting hard drive. What I'm seeing here... this is bigger than we thought. Much bigger. Stand by."*

---

## 🟡 ROUND 2: "INFILTRATION"
**Story Arc:** Veera discovers the Home Minister's betrayal and Operation BLACKOUT

### Level 2.1: The Corrupted Hash Trail
**Time:** 5:12 AM  
**Location:** Inside the vault, analyzing recovered hard drive  
**Story Moment:** Breaking through password-protected terrorist database

**Narrative Context:**
```
The hard drive contains three separate databases protected by password
hashes (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256). Each database holds critical intel:
sleeper cell identities, financial backers, and the cyber attack payload.
Crack all three passwords simultaneously.

HOSTAGE STATUS: 950 trapped | 250 rescued
TERRORISTS: 9 active (6 eliminated)
TIME TO NEXT EXECUTION: 22 minutes
ALERT: Government preparing to release Farooq from prison
```

**Preethi's Message (from hideout):**
*"Veera, they're saying on the news that the government is caving—they're going to release Farooq! Can you stop this?"*

**Veera's Response:**
*"Not if I decrypt these files first. Team, crack those hashes. I need the first 3 letters of each password, combined with '42'. Make it happen."*

**After solving:**
*"Master key worked. Accessing databases now. Wait... what is this? Financial transfers to... the HOME MINISTER? He's IN ON THIS!"*

---

### Level 2.2: The JWT Inception
**Time:** 5:50 AM  
**Location:** Terrorist admin panel  
**Story Moment:** Veera accesses the terrorist surveillance system

**Narrative Context:**
```
The admin panel requires JWT authentication. The token has been hex-encoded
to evade detection. Decode the hex, extract the JWT payload, retrieve the
secret, and reverse it to gain full control of the surveillance system.

HOSTAGE STATUS: 720 trapped | 480 rescued
TERRORISTS: 7 active (8 eliminated)
BREAKING: Home Minister's wife and daughter "executed" on live TV
WARNING: Execution appears STAGED
```

**Vikram's Message:**
*"The Home Minister just forced the government's hand with that execution. But our analysts think it was FAKE. Camera angles were too perfect. Veera, what do you see from inside?"*

**Veera's Response:**
*"The execution was theater. The Home Minister is working WITH Saif. Decode that JWT—I need admin access to their systems to prove it."*

**After solving:**
*"I'm in. Downloading evidence now. Bank transfers, encrypted comms, coordination logs—the Home Minister has been planning this for MONTHS."*

---

### Level 2.3: The Pattern Lock (Team-Specific)
**Time:** 6:15 AM  
**Location:** Final encrypted database  
**Story Moment:** Discovering the full scope of Operation BLACKOUT

**Narrative Context:**
```
The final database—containing the cyberattack payload and February 14
activation details—is protected by a team-specific pattern lock. Calculate
your unique SHA-256 hash using your team name, progress data, and the
secret salt "CIPHER2026". First 8 characters = your unlock code.

HOSTAGE STATUS: 520 trapped | 680 rescued
TERRORISTS: 5 active (10 eliminated)
ALERT: Farooq being transported to Pakistan border
COUNTDOWN TO BORDER CROSSING: 3 hours
```

**Althaf's Message (NSA):**
*"All teams: the Home Minister is confirmed as a traitor. Farooq is being released despite our protests. Veera, we need evidence from that database to arrest the Home Minister and stop the transfer."*

**Veera's Response:**
*"Team, this lock is personalized to prevent teams from sharing answers. Calculate YOUR hash based on YOUR data. Do it now—we're running out of time."*

**After solving:**
*"Database unlocked. I'm seeing the full attack plan. Operation BLACKOUT: a cyber worm targeting every server in CODISSIA Industrial Park. Activation: February 14, 23:59:59. Designed by a hacker called 'The Phantom'. Even if we stop the mall siege, this worm will still trigger unless we find the kill switch. This is a TWO-PHASE ATTACK."*

---

## 🔴 ROUND 3: "THE FINAL STRIKE"
**Story Arc:** Recapture Farooq, raid Saravana's hideout, defuse Operation BLACKOUT

### Level 3.1: The Payload Hunt
**Time:** 7:10 AM  
**Location:** Decoding the cyberattack files  
**Story Moment:** Understanding how Operation BLACKOUT works

**Narrative Context:**
```
Veera has been captured by Saif but escaped with help from Aparna (Home
Minister's daughter). The cyberattack payload is split across 4 encrypted
fragments (Binary, Hex, Base64, ROT13). Decode all four to understand
the activation mechanism—crucial for building the kill switch.

HOSTAGE STATUS: 280 trapped | 920 rescued
TERRORISTS: 3 active (12 eliminated by Veera)
STATUS: Veera injured but operational
BREAKING: Farooq has crossed Pakistan border - recapture mission underway
```

**Vikram's Message:**
*"Veera escaped but he's hurt. Teams, we need those payload fragments decoded NOW. If we understand how Operation BLACKOUT activates, we can reverse-engineer the kill switch. Four fragments, four different encodings. Decode and combine in order."*

**After solving:**
*"Payload structure decoded. It's a polymorphic worm—changes its signature every 24 hours. No traditional antivirus can stop it. We MUST find the kill switch."*

---

### Level 3.2: The Logic Bomb Defusal
**Time:** 7:35 AM  
**Location:** Main attack script analysis  
**Story Moment:** Preventing immediate system lockdown

**Narrative Context:**
```
CRITICAL ALERT: A logic bomb is embedded in the attack script. If not
defused correctly, Operation BLACKOUT will trigger IMMEDIATELY instead
of waiting until February 14. Defusal sequence: Hex → Base64 → ROT13 →
Binary → ASCII, then apply mathematical validation. ONE MISTAKE = CITY GOES DARK.

HOSTAGE STATUS: 85 trapped | 1,115 rescued
TERRORISTS: 1 active (Saif, surrounded)
TIME TO LOGIC BOMB TRIGGER: 10 minutes
VEERA STATUS: Escaping through service ducts
```

**Veera's Message (urgent, breathing heavily):**
*"I'm clear of Saif's forces. Hostages are evacuating. But there's a LOGIC BOMB in the code. If you don't defuse it perfectly—correct sequence, correct math validation—the worm triggers RIGHT NOW. Five encoding layers plus ASCII sum divisibility check. Do NOT get this wrong."*

**After solving:**
*"Logic bomb defused. Mall is clear. Saif is down. But Farooq crossed the border 2 hours ago. I'm going after him. Unofficial operation. Tell Althaf I'll bring Farooq back—and make him reveal The Phantom's location."*

---

### Level 3.3: The Master Vault (FINAL CHALLENGE)
**Time:** 8:00 AM (12 hours later)  
**Location:** Saravana's encrypted server (recovered after Farooq recaptured)  
**Story Moment:** THE FINAL KILL SWITCH

**Narrative Context:**
```
🚨 ALERT TO ALL TEAMS 🚨

Veera has successfully recaptured Umar Farooq in Pakistan and brought
him back to India. Under interrogation, Farooq revealed the identity
of "The Phantom" - a hacker named SARAVANA.
