## 🎬 WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL

### Traditional CTF Event:
"Solve these 9 cryptography challenges. Good luck!"

### Your Event (Operation Cipher Strike):
"Veera Raghavan, a former RAW agent haunted by a past mission, is trapped inside a terrorist-controlled mall with 1,200 hostages. You're his cyber unit. Every cipher you decode, every system you hack, saves lives. The mall siege is just the beginning—a cyber attack targeting 50,000 jobs is scheduled for Valentine's Day. You have 13 days to stop it. This isn't a competition. It's a rescue mission. And you're mission-critical."

**That's the difference.** 🎬
