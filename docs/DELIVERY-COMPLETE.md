## 🎬 THE BEAST PLOT ADAPTATION

### Original Movie (2022)
- Veera captures terrorist Farooq in Pakistan → child dies in mission
- 11 months later: PTSD, quits RAW, returns to Chennai
- Meets Preethi, joins security agency
- Mall siege by Farooq's brother (Umar Saif)
- 1,200 hostages, demand: release Farooq
- Home Minister secretly helps terrorists
- Veera fights from inside, exposes betrayal
- Government releases Farooq anyway
- Veera recaptures Farooq in Pakistan (cross-border raid)
- Hostages saved, terrorists eliminated, Veera redeemed

### Your Adaptation
**SAME AS MOVIE, PLUS:**
- **Players = Veera's cyber support team** (CERT-In interns)
- **Operation BLACKOUT** = secondary cyber attack (Feb 14 deadline)
- **Saravana "The Phantom"** = cyber-terrorist mastermind
- **Every CTF challenge = mission-critical task** for Veera
- **Real-time progression** = hostages rescued as teams solve challenges
- **Linear narrative** = 9 challenges = 9 story beats
- **Emotional stakes** = save 1,200 lives + 50,000 jobs + city's tech hub

**Result:** Same cinematic intensity as the movie, perfectly adapted to cybersecurity competition context
