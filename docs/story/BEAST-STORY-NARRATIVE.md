## 🎭 CAST OF CHARACTERS

### THE HEROES

**Veera Raghavan** (The Haunted Guardian 💀🔥)  
*Former RAW field agent, now broken and guilt-ridden.*

11 months ago, Veera successfully captured **Umar Farooq**, a notorious terrorist, in a high-stakes Pakistan operation. But when Farooq tried to escape, Veera fired a missile to prevent his getaway. The explosion killed a civilian child caught in the blast radius.

The mission was technically a success. Farooq was captured and brought to India. But the cost was unbearable.

Veera quit RAW immediately, returned to Chennai, and has been living with severe PTSD ever since—haunted by the child's face, unable to sleep, barely able to function. He stares at walls. He doesn't talk. He's a ghost in his own life.

**Preethi** (The Spark ✨)  
*Corporate strategist, Veera's anchor to humanity.*

Smart, grounded, and relentlessly optimistic. She meets Veera at a wedding (his psychiatrist forced him to go). She sees through his walls, senses the pain, and decides he deserves a second chance.

Over weeks, she convinces him to join **"Domnic & Soldiers"**, a failing private security agency. She believes broken people can be fixed—if someone cares enough.

**Domnic Irudhayaraj** (The Underdog 🛡️)  
*Owner of "Domnic & Soldiers" security agency.*

A former Tamil Nadu police officer turned private security entrepreneur. He's a good man trying to keep his dream alive, but his business is on the brink of bankruptcy.

The **CODISSIA Tech Mall** is his last remaining client—and his last hope to save the agency.

**Vikram Singaravelan** (The Code Warrior 💻)  
*Senior Cyber Crime Inspector, Tamil Nadu Police.*

Legendary in law enforcement circles for cracking over 200 cyber cases. When the mall siege begins, Vikram becomes the crucial bridge between Veera trapped inside and the government command outside.

**Deputy NSA Althaf Hussain** (The Negotiator 🎯)  
*National Security Advisor, leading national crisis response.*

Cool under pressure, strategic, and desperate. When he discovers that Veera Raghavan—the man who captured Farooq—is trapped inside the mall, he sees a slim chance to turn this nightmare into a counter-operation.

**You (The Cyber Unit) 💻🔓**  
*Elite cybersecurity interns recruited by CERT-In Tamil Nadu Division.*

You're not just players in a competition—you're Veera's lifeline. Every encrypted message you decode, every firewall you breach, every system you crack brings him one step closer to saving 1,200 hostages and stopping a nationwide cyber attack.

---

### THE VILLAINS

**Umar Farooq** (The Jailed Terrorist 🔒)  
*Currently imprisoned in Tamil Nadu's highest-security facility.*

The man Veera captured 11 months ago in Pakistan. Ruthless, internationally connected, and still dangerous even behind bars. He's been waiting. His brother is coming for him.

**Umar Saif** (The Avenger ☠️)  
*Farooq's younger brother, leading the CODISSIA Mall siege.*

Cold, calculating, and willing to execute innocent civilians on live television to force the government's hand. He's spent 11 months assembling sleeper cells across Coimbatore—agents disguised as mall staff, security guards, cleaners, and maintenance workers.

His only goal: **Get his brother back. No matter the cost. No matter how many people die.**

**The Home Minister** (The Traitor 🐍)  
*High-ranking Tamil Nadu government official—secretly working with Saif.*

Greed and political ambition have rotted him from the inside. He's willing to trade innocent lives for power and money. To force the government to release Farooq, he allows Saif to stage the "execution" of his own wife and daughter, Aparna, on live national television.

But he underestimates two things: Veera's tactical genius, and your team's hacking skills.

**Saravana "The Phantom"** (The Architect 👻)  
*The unseen cyber-terrorist mastermind behind Operation BLACKOUT.*

A brilliant hacker who designed the entire digital infrastructure for the attack. Even if the mall siege fails and Saif is killed, Saravana's malware will still trigger on **February 14, 23:59:59 IST**—Valentine's Day midnight—locking down every server, database, and network across CODISSIA Industrial Park.

Only by capturing Saravana and extracting the kill switch location can Operation BLACKOUT be permanently stopped.

---

## 💥 THE STAKES

- **1,200+ hostages** trapped inside CODISSIA Tech Mall, facing live executions
- **50,000+ tech employees** across the Industrial Park at risk of losing their jobs
- **₹2,000+ crore** in financial systems, research data, and proprietary business secrets at risk
- **National security:** Coimbatore produces 40% of India's industrial software and manufacturing tech
- **Live broadcast:** The terrorists are streaming executions on social media—every failure is public and permanent
- **Veera's redemption:** This is his one chance to save lives instead of ending them
- **Your mission:** Decode the ciphers. Hack the systems. Stop the attack. Save the city.

## 🎬 THE COMPLETE STORY (Linear Narrative Arc)

### PROLOGUE: THE SCAR THAT NEVER HEALED
**11 Months Ago - Somewhere in Pakistan, 2:34 AM**

*Gunfire echoes through a ruined compound near the Afghan border.*

*Veera Raghavan, RAW's most efficient and ruthless field agent, corners Umar Farooq in a crumbling safe house. The mission is seconds from success. Intel captured. Target neutralized. Extraction imminent.*

*Then Farooq makes a desperate run for a hidden exit in the back wall.*

*Veera calculates the risk in milliseconds. If Farooq escapes, he'll disappear into the militant networks and never be found again. Veera locks the missile targeting system and fires.*

*The explosion is perfect. The structure collapses. Farooq is captured alive, wounded but conscious.*

*Mission success.*

*But as the smoke clears and Veera's team secures the perimeter, he sees something in the rubble—a small body. A child. A little girl, maybe 8 years old. Caught in the blast radius. Wrong place. Wrong time. Collateral damage.*

*Acceptable loss, according to the mission parameters.*

*Except it isn't. Not to Veera. Not anymore.*

*He completes the mission. Brings Farooq back to India in handcuffs. Receives commendations from the government. Then walks into his commanding officer's office the next morning and resigns from RAW.*

*No explanation. No negotiation. No second thoughts.*

*Just a man who can't unsee what he's done.*

---

### ACT 1: THE RELUCTANT RETURN
**February 1, 2026, 2:00 AM - Chennai, Tamil Nadu**

11 months later, **Veera Raghavan** lives alone in a small, dark flat in Mylapore, Chennai. He barely sleeps. When he does, the child's face haunts him—her eyes, the dust, the silence after the explosion.

His psychiatrist, Dr. Meera, forces him to attend a cousin's wedding. "You need to be around people, Veera. You're disappearing."

There, he meets **Preethi**—a corporate strategy consultant, smart, warm, and somehow able to see past the walls he's built around himself. She doesn't ask about his past. She just... stays.

Over weeks, through coffee meetings and long walks along Marina Beach, she convinces him to join **"Domnic & Soldiers"**, a struggling private security agency run by **Domnic Irudhayaraj**, an ex-cop with a good heart and terrible business skills.

Their last client: **CODISSIA Tech Mall**, a massive six-floor shopping and technology complex in Coimbatore's Industrial Park—1,200 daily visitors, 300 employees, and 50,000 tech workers in the surrounding area.

On **February 1, 2026, at 2:30 AM**, Veera, Preethi, and Domnic drive to Coimbatore for a routine overnight security audit of the mall. Standard job. Easy money. Nothing dangerous.

But as they walk through the empty mall corridors at 3:00 AM, Veera notices things others miss:

- Maintenance workers wearing the wrong uniforms (logos don't match)
- New security cameras installed in blind spots (not in the building plans)
- Service corridors locked from the inside (should be accessible)
- Staff members who avoid eye contact and walk with military precision

His RAW instincts kick in. Something is very, very wrong.

He pulls Preethi aside. "We need to leave. Now."

But it's already too late.

---

### ACT 2: THE SIEGE BEGINS
**February 1, 2026, 3:12 AM - CODISSIA Tech Mall, Coimbatore**

**[GUNSHOTS. SCREAMS. CHAOS.]**

Across all six floors of the mall, sleeper cell operatives—disguised as janitors, security guards, food court staff, and maintenance workers—simultaneously pull weapons from hidden locations and open fire.

**Umar Saif**, wearing a tactical vest and carrying an assault rifle, walks calmly into the mall's main atrium and fires three shots into the air.

"EVERYONE ON THE GROUND! NOW!"

Exits are sealed with explosive charges. Mobile networks are jammed. Backup power is cut. The mall's internal security system is hijacked and broadcasting to the terrorists' network.

Over **1,200 people**—shoppers, employees, cleaning staff, security guards—are now hostages.

Saif walks to the center of the atrium, sets up a camera, and broadcasts live on social media:

**"My name is Umar Saif. 11 months ago, the Indian government and a RAW agent named Veera Raghavan captured my brother, Umar Farooq, and imprisoned him in Tamil Nadu. Today, I am taking back what was stolen from my family.**

**My demand is simple: Release Umar Farooq from prison and deliver him safely to the Pakistan border within 12 hours.**

**If you refuse, I will execute one hostage every 30 minutes. Live. On camera. For the world to see.**

**The Indian government claims to protect its people. Let's test that claim.**

**The countdown begins now."**

The feed goes viral within minutes. News channels pick it up. Panic spreads across the nation.

---

Meanwhile, Veera, Preethi, Domnic, and about 15 other people manage to hide inside the kitchen of an unopened restaurant on the fourth floor. They barricade the door, turn off the lights, and stay silent.

Preethi is terrified. Domnic is shaking. But Veera's mind is already calculating angles, exits, and probabilities.

---

**At RAW Headquarters, New Delhi**

**Deputy NSA Althaf Hussain** is woken up at 3:30 AM with the news. A terrorist siege. Live executions threatened. Social media wildfire. Political nightmare.

The Tamil Nadu Police and NSG commandos are mobilizing, but a direct assault will result in mass casualties. Negotiations are the only option.

Then Althaf gets a notification from the field team:

**"Sir, we just ran biometric scans of everyone who entered the mall in the last 6 hours. One match flagged: Veera Raghavan. Former RAW field operative. He's inside the mall."**

Althaf freezes. Veera. The man who captured Farooq. The man who quit after the Pakistan incident. The best tactical operative RAW ever had.

He's trapped inside the very building under siege by the brother of the man he captured.

Althaf immediately establishes covert communication through a hidden server terminal in the mall's IT room. He sends an encrypted message to Veera's old RAW device (which Veera still carries, out of habit).

**Althaf (via encrypted chat):** *"Veera, this is Althaf. I know you're inside. I need you to help us. You're the only one who can stop this."*

**Veera (staring at the screen):** *"I'm done, Althaf. I'm not your weapon anymore."*

**Althaf:** *"Then 1,200 people die today. Including the woman you came here with. Your choice."*

Veera closes his eyes. The faces of hostages flash in his mind. Preethi's terrified expression. The child in Pakistan.

He makes a decision.

**Veera:** *"I need a team. A cyber unit. People who can hack systems, decode files, and break encryptions faster than these terrorists can react. I can handle the physical side. But I need digital support."*

**Althaf:** *"Already on it. CERT-In Tamil Nadu is pulling elite cybersecurity interns from colleges in Coimbatore. They'll be online in 10 minutes. I'll connect you directly."*

**Veera:** *"Make it 5."*

---

**That team... is YOU.**

**From your secure location (competition venue), you are now Veera's eyes, ears, and digital weapons. Every challenge you solve gives Veera the intel, access, or tools he needs to fight back from inside the mall.**

**This isn't just a competition anymore.**

**It's a rescue operation. And you're mission-critical.**

---

## 🔓 ROUND 1: "THE BREACH DISCOVERY"
**Theme:** Cryptography & Code Breaking  
**Your Mission:** Decode encrypted terrorist communications to locate their command center

### Level 1.1: The Intercepted Transmission
**Time:** 3:47 AM - Veera Inside Mall, Hidden Server Room

**Veera (via comms to your team):** *"I've tapped into their network using a backdoor in the mall's security server. They're communicating through encrypted messages—triple-layer encryption. Base64, ROT13, and string reversal. Classic overconfident terrorist tradecraft. If you can decode this intercepted transmission, I'll know where their command center is inside the mall. Fast. I need this fast."*

**Vikram (from Tamil Nadu Police Cyber Command HQ):** *"We just intercepted this message from their dark web relay server. It's addressed to Saif. Decode it and you'll find the location."*

**Preethi (whispering from the kitchen hideout):** *"Veera, please be careful. And thank you—whoever you are—for helping us."*

**YOUR TASK:**  
Decode the triple-encoded message (Base64 → ROT13 → Reverse) to reveal the terrorist command location inside the mall.

**Answer Format:** `HTB{decoded_location}`

---

### Level 1.2: The Fragmented Server Map
**Time:** 4:15 AM - Veera Infiltrating Lower Levels

**Veera:** *"Good work. The command center is in Server Room ER-42, East Wing, basement level. But Saif fragmented the access code across three encrypted files stored in different parts of the network. Each one uses a different encoding method—Hexadecimal, Binary, and Caesar cipher. You need to decode all three fragments and combine them in the correct sequence to get the full access code. The format is: Fragment-A + Fragment-B + Fragment-C, separated by underscores."*

**Domnic (via radio):** *"Veera, they're moving hostages to the main food court. They're setting up execution cameras. We're running out of time!"*

**Veera:** *"Then work faster."*

**YOUR TASK:**  
Decode three fragments (Hex, Binary, Caesar cipher) from separate files and assemble them in order to create the server room access code.

**Answer Format:** `HTB{FRAGMENT_A_FRAGMENT_B_FRAGMENT_C}`

---

### Level 1.3: The Time-Locked Vault
**Time:** 4:45 AM - Vault Security System Active

**Veera:** *"We've reached Server Room ER-42. But there's a biometric time-locked vault protecting the main drives. The security log shows a mathematical unlock formula: CODE = UNIX_TIMESTAMP(event_start) + TEAM_SIZE + ROUND_NUMBER. Convert the result to hexadecimal and take the last 8 digits. Your team's event registration timestamp is your key. This is personalized security—every team gets a unique answer. Calculate yours."*

**Vikram (urgent tone):** *"Veera, they just executed the first hostage on camera. The clock is ticking. 25 minutes until the next one."*

**Veera:** *"I know. We're moving."*

**YOUR TASK:**  
Calculate the vault unlock code using:
- Your exact event registration timestamp (Unix format)
- Your team member count (2)
- Current round number (1)
- Convert sum to hexadecimal, take last 8 characters

**Answer Format:** `HTB{HEX_CODE}`

---

**[VAULT OPENS]**

**Veera:** *"I'm in. There's a hard drive here labeled 'OPERATION BLACKOUT - PHASE 2'. It contains Saif's complete attack plan, backup locations, sleeper cell identities, and... wait. There's more. A SECOND ATTACK scheduled for February 14th—a cyber attack targeting the entire Industrial Park. This mall siege is just a distraction. The real target is much bigger."*

**Althaf (via secure NSA channel):** *"Veera, what are you seeing?"*

**Veera:** *"This isn't just about freeing Farooq. They're planning to cripple Coimbatore's entire tech infrastructure in 13 days. We need to crack these files. NOW."*

---

## 🔐 ROUND 2: "INFILTRATION"
**Theme:** Hash Cracking & Token Analysis  
**Your Mission:** Break into terrorist admin systems and extract the kill switch location

### ACT 3: THE COUNTERATTACK
**Time:** 5:12 AM - Inside the Vault, Hard Drive Recovered

**Veera:** *"This hard drive is encrypted with three separate password hashes from different security systems—MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256. The passwords protect different parts of the attack plan: sleeper cell roster, financial backers, and the cyberattack payload. I need all three cracked simultaneously. The key assembly instructions say: take the first 3 letters of each cracked password, combine them in order, and append the number '42' (the server room we're in). That's the master decryption key."*

**Preethi (via hidden mic):** *"Veera, I just heard Saif on the radio. The Home Minister announced the government is caving—they're preparing to release Farooq from prison!"*

**Veera:** *"Not if I can stop it. Team, crack those hashes. Move!"*

---

### Level 2.1: The Corrupted Hash Trail
**Time:** 5:25 AM - Database Breach In Progress

**YOUR TASK:**  
Crack three password hashes:
1. MD5 hash (hint: admin's pet name, 6 letters)
2. SHA-1 hash (hint: single digit number, written out)
3. SHA-256 hash (hint: common password + "123")

Extract the first 3 letters of each cracked password, combine them, and add "42" at the end.

**Answer Format:** `HTB{COMBINED_KEY42}`

---

### Level 2.2: The JWT Inception
**Time:** 5:50 AM - Admin Panel Authentication Required

**Veera:** *"Master key worked. I'm inside the terrorist admin panel. But there's a nested authentication token here—a JWT (JSON Web Token) that's been hex-encoded to hide it from automated scanners. You need to decode the hex to get the JWT, then decode the JWT payload to extract the secret access code, then reverse that code. It's paranoid security—multiple layers to slow us down."*

**Vikram:** *"Veera, Saif just executed another hostage on live TV. This is escalating fast."*

**Veera:** *"I know. Keep working."*

**YOUR TASK:**  
Decode a hex-encoded JWT token, extract the payload, retrieve the secret code, and reverse it.

**Answer Format:** `HTB{REVERSED_SECRET}`

---

### Level 2.3: The Pattern Lock (Team-Specific Challenge)
**Time:** 6:15 AM - Final Database Barrier

**Veera:** *"Almost there. But Saif's final database—the one with the cyber attack payload—has a pattern lock. It's dynamically generated based on the investigating team's data. The formula is: SHA-256 hash of [YOUR_TEAM_NAME] + [CURRENT_ROUND] + [CHALLENGES_SOLVED_SO_FAR] + [SECRET_SALT: CIPHER2026]. Take the first 8 characters of your hash. This is an anti-sharing mechanism—every team gets a unique answer based on their own progress."*

**Althaf (via emergency broadcast):** *"All teams, be advised: the Home Minister just staged a fake execution of his own wife and daughter on live TV to force the government's hand. But our intel suggests the Home Minister is IN ON THIS. He's working with Saif. This is bigger than we thought."*

**Veera:** *"I KNEW something was off. The execution looked staged. The camera angles, the timing—it was all theater. The Home Minister is a traitor."*

**YOUR TASK:**  
Calculate your team's unique SHA-256 hash:
- Your actual team name
- Current round (2)
- Number of challenges solved so far (5)
- Secret salt: CIPHER2026

Submit the first 8 characters of the resulting hash.

**Answer Format:** `HTB{FIRST_8_CHARS}`

---

**[DATABASE UNLOCKED]**

**Veera:** *"Got it. The Home Minister has been coordinating with Saif for months. Bank transfers, encrypted communications, everything. And the cyberattack—Operation BLACKOUT—is real. It's a worm designed by a hacker named Saravana 'The Phantom'. On February 14th at midnight, it will encrypt every server in the Industrial Park unless we find the kill switch. We need to stop both attacks—the mall siege AND Operation BLACKOUT."*

---

## 💥 ROUND 3: "THE FINAL STRIKE"
**Theme:** Integrated Cyber Warfare Challenge  
**Your Mission:** Defuse the logic bomb, stop the mall siege, and prevent Operation BLACKOUT

### ACT 4: THE BETRAYAL
**Time:** 6:45 AM - The Plan Changes

**Vikram:** *"Veera, you were right. Evidence confirms the Home Minister has been working with Saif. They forced the government to release Farooq—he's being escorted to the Pakistan border as we speak. We're losing!"*

**Veera:** *"Then I change the game. I'm going to kidnap the Home Minister's wife and daughter—for REAL this time, not a staged execution. I'll threaten to expose the Home Minister's treason if Farooq crosses the border. It's the only leverage we have left."*

**Preethi:** *"Veera, that's insane! You'll be a criminal!"*

**Veera:** *"I already am. At least this time it's for the right reasons."*

---

Veera infiltrates the terrorist network by disguising himself as a captured hostage (using a dead terrorist's uniform). He locates and "rescues" **Aparna** (the Home Minister's daughter) and her mother, then broadcasts a counter-threat to Saif and the government:

**"Release Farooq, and I'll expose the Home Minister's treason to the world. The evidence is ready. Your choice."**

Chaos erupts. Saif realizes there's a mole inside his operation. He starts interrogating people. **Domnic**, under extreme pressure, accidentally reveals Veera's real identity.

Saif's cells capture Veera.

But **Aparna**, realizing her father is a traitor and Veera is trying to save innocent people, helps Veera escape during a firefight.

---

### Level 3.1: The Payload Hunt (Multi-Fragment Challenge)
**Time:** 7:10 AM - Decoding the Cyberattack Files

**Vikram (via emergency broadcast to all teams):** *"Veera's been captured but he escaped! The attack files are accessible now. The cyberattack payload is split across FOUR encrypted memory fragments, each using a different encoding method: Binary, Hexadecimal, Base64, and ROT13. You must decode all four fragments and combine them in the exact order to reveal the activation code. This is what triggers Operation BLACKOUT. If we know the activation code, we can reverse-engineer the kill switch."*

**YOUR TASK:**  
Decode four separate encrypted fragments:
- Fragment 1 (Binary) → ASCII
- Fragment 2 (Hex) → ASCII
- Fragment 3 (Base64) → Text
- Fragment 4 (ROT13) → Text

Combine all four in order, separated by underscores.

**Answer Format:** `HTB{FRAG1_FRAG2_FRAG3_FRAG4}`

---

### Level 3.2: The Logic Bomb Defusal
**Time:** 7:35 AM - Critical System Threat

**Veera (escaped, back online via emergency comms):** *"I'm out. Aparna helped me escape—she's brave. But there's a LOGIC BOMB embedded in Saif's attack script. If we don't defuse it correctly, Operation BLACKOUT triggers IMMEDIATELY instead of waiting until February 14th. The defusal sequence is complex: Hex → Base64 → ROT13 → Binary → ASCII. Then calculate the sum of ASCII values of all characters. If the sum is divisible by 7, add suffix '_PRIME'. If not, add '_COMPOSITE'. One wrong move, and we lose the city."*

**Preethi:** *"Veera, Saif is regrouping his forces. You have maybe 10 minutes before he finds you again. Hurry!"*

**YOUR TASK:**  
Decode a deeply nested payload through 5 layers:
1. Hexadecimal → ASCII
2. Result is Base64 → decode
3. Result is ROT13 → shift
4. Result is Binary → convert to ASCII
5. Calculate sum of ASCII values of final text
6. Check if divisible by 7
7. Add correct suffix (_PRIME or _COMPOSITE)

**Answer Format:** `HTB{DECODED_TEXT_SUFFIX}`

---

**[LOGIC BOMB DEFUSED]**

**Veera:** *"Logic bomb neutralized. Hostages are escaping through the service exits I opened. Saif's cells are down. But Farooq has already crossed the Pakistan border. The only way to stop Operation BLACKOUT permanently is to RECAPTURE Farooq and force him to reveal Saravana's location."*

**Althaf:** *"Veera, you can't go back into Pakistan. You're not RAW anymore. This would be an illegal cross-border operation."*

**Veera:** *"Then don't make it official. I'll go alone. Give me 24 hours."*

---

**[12 Hours Later - Pakistan Border Region]**

Veera crosses into Pakistani territory (off the books), tracks Farooq to a militant compound near Peshawar, and—after an intense firefight and a dramatic helicopter chase—recaptures him and brings him back to India alive.

Under interrogation, Farooq reveals the identity and location of **Saravana "The Phantom"**—the cyber-terrorist mastermind. RAW and Tamil Nadu Police jointly raid Saravana's hideout in Bangalore and recover his encrypted server—the master vault containing the final kill switch for Operation BLACKOUT.

---

### Level 3.3: The Master Vault (FINAL CHALLENGE - WINNER TAKES ALL)
**Time:** 8:00 AM (Day 2) - All Teams Receive Alert

**[SYSTEM-WIDE ALERT BROADCAST TO ALL COMPETITION TEAMS]**

**Althaf (to all cyber teams):** *"Attention all teams. This is Deputy NSA Althaf Hussain. Thanks to your efforts and Veera Raghavan's field operation, we have captured the master vault—Saravana's encrypted server containing the FINAL KILL SWITCH for Operation BLACKOUT. This vault is protected by EVERYTHING you've learned: hex encoding, JWT decoding, ROT13 cipher, hash verification, and nested logic. You have 15 MINUTES starting NOW. The first team to decode the master flag and submit it will PERMANENTLY DISABLE Operation BLACKOUT and receive DOUBLE POINTS (2000 instead of 1000). All other teams who solve within 15 minutes get standard 1000 points. After 15 minutes, the challenge locks forever. The clock is ticking. Save Coimbatore. Good luck."*

**[COUNTDOWN TIMER APPEARS ON SCREEN: 15:00... 14:59... 14:58...]**

---

**YOUR FINAL TASK:**  
Decode the ultimate master flag through a massively complex sequence:

**Step 1:** Hex-encoded package → decode to ASCII (reveals a JWT)  
**Step 2:** Decode the JWT payload (extract "master_vault" field)  
**Step 3:** The field contains an array of two strings  
**Step 4:** Apply ROT13 to the second string  
**Step 5:** Reverse the result  
**Step 6:** Combine both strings  
**Step 7:** Verify with SHA-256 hash (given in instructions)  
**Step 8:** If hash matches, submit as final flag  

**Answer Format:** `HTB{MASTER_FLAG_TEXT}`

---

## 🏆 EPILOGUE: THE RECKONING
**February 1, 2026, 8:47 AM - Crisis Resolved**

**[YOUR TEAM SUBMITS THE CORRECT KILL SWITCH CODE]**

**[OPERATION BLACKOUT: TERMINATED]**

**[ALL SYSTEMS: SECURE]**

**Veera (via final video message to all teams):**

*"You did it. The master vault is unlocked. Operation BLACKOUT is permanently disabled. The malware is deleted. 50,000 lives saved. The Home Minister is in custody for treason. Saif and his sleeper cells are neutralized. Farooq is back in maximum security. Saravana 'The Phantom' is arrested. And for the first time in 11 months... I can close my eyes without seeing that child's face.*

*I thought I was done. That I'd never be able to save anyone again. But you proved me wrong.*

*This wasn't just hacking. This wasn't just a competition. You were part of a REAL operation. Every code you cracked, every cipher you solved—it mattered. It saved lives.*

*Thank you. From me, from Preethi, from Domnic, from the 1,200 hostages who made it out alive, and from a city that doesn't even know your names but owes you everything."*

**Preethi (appearing on screen next to Veera):** *"You gave him his life back. Thank you."*

**Althaf:** *"Veera, RAW wants you back. Full reinstatement. No questions asked."*

**Veera (smiling for the first time):** *"I'll think about it. Right now, I'm taking Preethi, Domnic, and the crew to Goa. We earned a vacation."*

**[The screen fades to black. The scoreboard updates. The winners are announced. Cheers erupt in the competition hall.]**
