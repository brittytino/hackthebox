## 🎯 STORY OVERVIEW: BEAST ADAPTATION

### Original Movie Plot
**Veera Raghavan**, a RAW agent, captures terrorist **Umar Farooq** in Pakistan but accidentally kills a civilian child in the process. Traumatized, he quits and returns to Chennai with severe PTSD. 11 months later, he joins a failing security agency and visits a mall for a routine job.

**Umar Saif** (Farooq's brother) hijacks the mall with sleeper cells, demanding Farooq's release. Veera, trapped inside, fights back while the **Home Minister** (secretly working with terrorists) forces the government to release Farooq. Veera exposes the betrayal, eliminates the terrorists, recaptures Farooq in Pakistan, and finds redemption.

### Our Cyber Adaptation
**Everything stays the same PLUS:**
- **Players are Veera's cyber support team** (CERT-In interns recruited by NSA)
- **Operation BLACKOUT**: a secondary cyber attack targeting Coimbatore's tech hub on Feb 14
- **Saravana "The Phantom"**: cyber-terrorist who designed the digital attack infrastructure
- **Every challenge = a mission-critical task** Veera needs completed from inside the mall
- **Linear progression**: Story unfolds as players solve challenges
- **Emotional stakes**: Hostage rescues, terrorist eliminations, and city-saving tension
